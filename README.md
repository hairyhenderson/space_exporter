# hairyhenderson/space_exporter

This is a sample Prometheus exporter developed for the
[Grafana & Friends Ottawa](https://www.meetup.com/grafana-friends-ottawa/) meetup.

It's a simple Go application that uses the
[People in Space](http://open-notify.org/Open-Notify-API/People-In-Space/) API to
expose metrics about the number of people currently in space.
